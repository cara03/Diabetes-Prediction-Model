# Diabetes Prediction Model
The goal of this project is to develop a machine learning model that predicts the likelihood of an individual developing diabetes based on factors such as age, BMI, blood pressure, glucose levels, and family history. The model aims to provide early detection, helping healthcare professionals and individuals take preventive measures. By using statistical and machine learning techniques, the model analyzes historical data to identify patterns and trends that can predict diabetes onset.

Tools and Technologies Used:\
Python: For data processing, modeling, and analysis.
Libraries: Pandas, NumPy (for data manipulation and analysis), Matplotlib, Seaborn (for data visualization).
Machine Learning Libraries: Scikit-learn (for traditional machine learning algorithms like logistic regression, decision trees), Keras, TensorFlow (for deep learning models, if applicable).
Jupyter Notebooks: For interactive data exploration, model building, and visualization.
